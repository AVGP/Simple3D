How to port this to other platforms
===================================
>>>Preface:<<<

One of the primary design goals of this engine was,
to keep it as portable as possible.
This is allows to port it to any platform that is
abled to draw points.
Let it be any pc-platform, handheld or embedded
devices - as long as it is abled to draw pixels,
you can port to it and use Simple3D.

>>>How?<<<
Here is how you can port the library.

Step 1: Change the global.h according to your system
		I.e. change the X11-includes to whatever
		suits your platform.
Step 2: Adapt the types.h typedefs accordingly.
Step 3: Change the setup and platform-dependent things
		in Simple3D.cpp
Step 4: Change the specific lines in S3DLine.cpp
		to fit your system's requirements to draw points.
And you're done! Easy, isn't it?
